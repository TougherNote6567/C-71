                <p>This movie is fast-paced; yet, it doesn't feel rushed or scrambled in the slightest. It is sure to keep both parents and kids entertained as the storyline progresses quickly and keeps you on your toes. It sends a good message to people as well--your creation may seem purely beneficial, but it may have some negatives you must consider before releasing it into the world. It can affect people socially, economically, and politically. It isn't solely up to the creators to monitor their creations impact, but the consumer must be wary as well. Both feed into the creation and may create a neverending cycle of destruction, so both must come together to work and create a better tomorrow. </p>

                <p>This is the best film ever. I love it. The whole thing is like a massive therapy session for Ralph, he basically gaslights everyone and overreacts and then learns how to not be a doughbag from a blue lady, and a bunch of other irellevant supporting cast! So fun. I loved all the little referances, like the "Road Work Ahead" sign in the kid's bedroom, the little clip of Nick from 'Zootopia', the part where Ariel sings, that was so fun. If you are someone who generally knows about memes and spends a lot of time on the internet you should probably find all these little referances and easter eggs fun to find and point them out when you do!</p>

                <p>Alec Baldwin finally secures his long sought after Oscar-worthy performance in the animated thriller The Boss Baby. Baldwin made me truly believe that he was both a boss and a baby. A good actor could make me believe that they were a Boss Baby; only the greatest of actors, who Baldwin is among, could make me believe that they were The Boss Baby. Director Tom McGrath assembled an impressive supporting cast as well with show business legends Steve Buscemi and Tobey Maguire. Hanz Zimmer has possibly his greatest score of all time, and I've watched half of Interstellar. Both filmography and cinematography were truly innovative, and the use of CGI, while clich√©, was well placed and imperceptible to only the most trained of eyes. I left the theatre with the knowledge that Tom McGrath is not only one of the great directors, but a true devotee to cinema.</p>

It goes deep into the very exciting story it tells while also building up the development of the main characters‚Äô emotions and chemistry between each other. The unexpected climax, which would normally be a bad move in any other story, was flawlessly built up to throughout the beginning of the series and plays out unforgettably with the tragic ending that leaves the audience in suspense. <br><br>

                        <p class="p_modal"> Wonder by RJ Palacio was astonishing! I think the book was for grades fifth-eighth grade, and adults would like it. This book can teach many different lessons. The one that stood out to me was not to judge by the way someone looked but by the inner character of that person. It is one of the most moving books I have read in a long time, and I am still pretty amazed at how the author wove so much complexity into a story for middle schoolers. Take-home messages included, you can count on your parents even if things get tough, sometimes people make mistakes and deserve second chances, sometimes you just have to suck it up and endure and most importantly, in general, things change over time.<br><br>

It's about a girl named Esperanza who was raised by a rich and wealthy family in Mexico, who owned a ranch and lived in a beautiful mansion. Until disaster struck when her family had to move to California during the Great Depression. What makes this book so good is the character development. Esperanza first starts off as a spoiled child and slowly turns into a responsible caring daughter. This book had many inspired events and references from the Great Depression. I recommend getting this book! I'm 10 years old and I'm in love this book!<br><br>
